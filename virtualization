compute, storage, networks

hypervisor makes feasible

hypervisor - software runs above host

allocates resources

type 1 - bare metal hyper hypervisor
type 2 - hosted, less used, end user virtualiation, virtual box, higher latency

software based computer

cost savings

multiple vitual environments from one Infrastructure
reduce number of servers, electricity, maintenance constraints

agility and speed
