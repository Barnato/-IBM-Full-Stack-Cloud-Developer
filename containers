VM vs Containers

hardware
host OS
hypervisor - spring up VM

linux VM
Guest + host OS


to create Linux VM we need guest OS

push JS application consumes resources

scaling this about.

JS application developed on mac book - incompabilities on Linux.

Things work ok on local machine but not when push to production, gets in way of agile and delivery.

Create image. Image - can be made with Docker or Rocket (containeriation technology)

Host operaitng systems

Run time engine

Docker engine

Scenario: JS application - image recognition. Got third part srvrice, access using Pthyon application.

Create VM, JS + Python applications

But scalability issiues if JS + Python apps in same VM

would have to have two VMS

Container based approach is better - can deploy one copu of the Python application.

Shared between all the processes

Containers are more portable, can scale them out, streamline deployment of cloud native applications
