Week 4

Encryption

Last line of defence

- Certificate management
- scrambling data so it is inelligible
- key transforms back to legible
- keys need to be managed securely
- data, in rest (database storage - Encryption for block + file storage, database encryption),
in transit (encrpting data before transmission and arrival, TLS protocol for encryption in transit)
in use (in computational memory)
- customer supplied encryption keys
- multi cloud, single encryption strategy accross clouds
- data access management, integrated key management
- protect sensitive workloads regardless of where data resides
- audit keys
- master and recovery keys
