# Introduction to web development

* Cloud app development includes version control, libraries and frameworks.

## Libraries

* *Libraries* are collections of code like standard programs and sub routines that you can reuse within your code - you might want to include a navigational feature like a carousel.

* Saves time - donâ€™t have time to write all
code from scratch - can **integrate libraries** into code for multiple features.

* You can search for a specific feature within a library.

* Multiple libraries can be integrated into one project.

Frameworks define the **workflow** you must follow - how code is written, location of files, and file names.
