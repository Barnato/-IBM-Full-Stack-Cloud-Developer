# HTML5 Browser Support

* Some browsers suppport HTML5 features but not all. e.g., calendar shows dates strangely in Firefox.  

* Google Chrome supports most HTML5 elements.

* Can use Javascript to check if certain element is supported by a browser.

* Javascrpt - is HTML5 element suppported by browser - test whether `input type= ‘date’ &gt;` element. Do so using Dom element - `document.createElement()` if browser does not may just show input as a text element.
