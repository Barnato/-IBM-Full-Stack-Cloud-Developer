Basics of Cloud Storage

cloud providers host + secure cloud storage and Infrastructure

per GB basis

faster read + write higher costs

direct attached - presented directly to server, in same rack, v fast but only lasts as long as compute resource, failure issue
file Storage - network file system, common, slower than direct attached, over ethernet, but it can be mounted on multip;e servers
object storage - cheapest + slowest. Read/write. But infinite in size. Unstructured data, videos, logs, documents

back up file and block storage - snapshot, point in time Image

quick and create meta data
