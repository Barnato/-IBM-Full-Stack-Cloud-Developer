Week 4

Serveless Computing

Offloads infrastructure tasks:
patching
Provisioning
scheduling
Scaling

Management of servers - removed from developers

Allocates resources as needed for apps

pay only for resources being used

serverless computing services

AWS Lambda
IBM Functions

serverless is well suited to

Text files
Audio
Image
Video

Tasks include:
 data enrichment
Transformation
Validation and cleansing
PDF processing
Audio normalization
Thumbnail generation video transcoding

Problems with serverless:
scale up and down in response to workload
traditional server env might be better for long-running processes
