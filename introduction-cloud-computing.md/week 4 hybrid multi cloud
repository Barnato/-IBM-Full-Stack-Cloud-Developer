Private cloud + third party cloud

Why business use a hybrid multi cloud?

Cloud scaling?

on-premises - use a certain number of users, but load is seasonal
To hit those peaks could scale up on-premises arch but could also take advantage of cloud can scale, automatic increase/decrease

Business could have on-premise - can support web + billing and rewards API (EU)
decide to take advantage of hybrid cloud to compose application across multiple cloud environments
Move billing and UI capabilities over - North American data center
So can scale up for America holidays but keep EU portions at normal levels

Reservation systems might be difficult but all airlines have mobile applications
80% of all enterprise still on-premises
reservation system on premises
