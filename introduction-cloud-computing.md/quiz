Week 3 practice Quiz

Virtual servers, bare metal servers, and serverless computing resources are compute resources of cloud infrastructure

Windows, Linux, UNIX are computer OS that typically run on virtual machines

transient or Spot VMs offer unused capacity from data centers at lower costs

bare metal servers take longer to provision than virtual servers, as they are physical machiens

subnets are the smaller segments of networking spaces where cloud resources are deployed and security is implemented

file storage is not local. It is accessed via a standard ethernet network.

File storage is sometimes called NFS

file storage - high speed fibre network

Object Storage > standard tier bucket > storing objects that are frequently accessed - highest gigabyte cost associated with it

VMware ESX and ESXI, Microsoft Hyper-V, open-source KVM

hypervisors serve as an interface between a virtual machine and the underlying physicql hardware

file storage is not local - it is accessed via a standard ethernet network

block storage - fibre network

fibre storage and block storage - highly resilient and available

object storage is infinite

cloud region is a geographic area where cloud provider's infrastructure is clustered

Zone - unique physical locations with one or more data centers

single tenant computer enviroments - dedicate hosts + bare metal server?

a virtual machine is a software based computer that runs like a physical computer, need a virtual copy of the hardware and OS

Object storage is accessed via an API and persists until explicitly de-provisioned

file storage is slower because connects to computer nodes over standard ethernet network

block storage suitable for low latency workloads, but expensive due to needin high fibre network

block storage is persistent, even using high fibre network

you can use object storage without connecting it to computer node
